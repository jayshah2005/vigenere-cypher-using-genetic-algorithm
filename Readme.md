GA is the main class used for running the Gentic Algorithm. You can change the parameters for the GA by opening the GA class and changing the main file. 

An executable configuration is available to test the algorithm. 

GA, Evaluation and chromosome are the main classes needed for the GA.csvWriters and experiment are helper classes to collect data and record findings.

Final_Report_COSC_3P71_Assignment_1.pdf is the final report. All the collected data is present in the Data folder. If you create new data using the experiment class, it will not override the previous data. Instead, the data will be created in the outside the Data directory. 

Graphs contain all the graphs generated from the data we collected. A combination of Excel, Matplot, and SciPy were used to analyse all the collected data. Basic aggregation was done using Java inside the classes itself.
